This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms, highlighting a deep understanding of core computer science concepts. It includes implementations of essential data structures such as **stacks**, **queues**, **linked lists**, **arrays**, **ArrayLists**, and **hash maps**. Additionally, it features various sorting algorithms, including **bubble sort**, **insertion sort**, **selection sort**, **merge sort**, and **quick sort**, as well as searching algorithms like **binary search** and **linear search**. Each implementation is accompanied by algorithm analysis to evaluate time and space complexity, demonstrating an ability to not only apply these concepts but also analyze their efficiency. This repository serves as a practical resource for learning and understanding the critical principles of computer science.
