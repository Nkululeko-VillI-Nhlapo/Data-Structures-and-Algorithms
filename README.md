## Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of **fundamental data structures** and **algorithms** implemented in Java. It includes practical implementations of core data structures such as **stacks**, **priority queues**, **linked lists**, **arrays**, **ArrayLists**, **queues**, and **hashmaps**. Alongside these structures, various **sorting algorithms** are provided, including **bubble sort**, **insertion sort**, **selection sort**, **merge sort**, **quick sort**, and **binary search**, as well as **linear search**. Each algorithm is implemented with attention to **algorithmic efficiency** and **performance**, including detailed analysis and comparisons. This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding and applying essential concepts in computer science, offering both **theoretical insights** and **practical coding examples** to facilitate learning and application of these foundational elements.
